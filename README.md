# Angular2-Time

Angular2-Time is a *very simple* Angular 2 app that shows the current local time.
The app has two modes:


1. Light Mode
2. Dark Mode


The mode is chosen based on the time.

### Instructions

Install the required packages using `npm`.

```
npm install
```

Open `index.html` and your clock should be running!

Alternatively,

```
npm start
```

simultaneously starts a `lite-server` that serves `index.html` and watches for
any file changes to reload the webpage.
